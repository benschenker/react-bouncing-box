## React/Redux Bouncing Box

The first thing I like to do when I encounter a new tool is try to recreate a simple game where a box bounces across the screen. See
[my first implementation with jquery](
https://github.com/benschenker/bouncing-box
).

It uses react and redux guided by the amazing tutorial at [teropa.info](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html)
